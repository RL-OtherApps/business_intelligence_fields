BI Invoice Company Currency
===========================

This modules adds several stored computed fields:

* on invoice line: price_subtotal_company_currency and price_unit_company_currency

* in invoice: amount_untaxed_company_currency and amount_total_company_currency

This module also replaces the object *account.invoice.report* (used by the menu entry *Reporting > Accounting > Invoice Analysis*) by another object *account.invoice.report.bi* that uses the new stored computed fields.""",
